# CompanyHierarchyStructure
Implementation of Company Hierarchy Structure using the Composite Design Pattern.

## Considerations
Caters for:
- Employee/Manager working is not an employee of the company
- Employee with no Manager
- Employee/Manager could have job type: contractor, permanent, part time etc

## Several possible extensions I considered that are out of scope:
- Employee/Manager could be on Leave 
- Employee/Manager could have more than one manager
- Employee/Manager leaves organisation
- Employee/Manager could have Job title
- Employee/Manager could have extra information i.e. DOB etc.
- The Executives (CIO, CEO, CFO) could be seen as on the same hierarchy level.
- A former Employee/Manager's position could be vacant.
